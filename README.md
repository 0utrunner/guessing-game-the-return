# Guess A Number

## This challenge will help you to:
- Implement HTML elements that use specific attributes to perform actions
- Implement CSS styling using `id=`s and `class=`es
- Use Javascript to interact with your web page or the Docuement Object Model (DOM)
- Use HTML or DOM methods to change your webpage

## Summary
Let's create a simple number guessing game. The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 100 and you will have to guess that number.


## Requirements

1. The user should be able to guess a number until they guess the right number.
2. The user should be able to input a number and click a button to submit the number.
3. The webpage should inform the user to guess a higher number, guess a lower number, or tell the user they guessed the correct number.
4. The webpage should list all guessed numbers the user guessed during the session.

Your number guessing game will consist of an HTML file, CSS file, and a Javascript file.

## HTML File
Your HTML file is already given to you with a `<nav>` element and a `<h1>` tag.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>TITLE</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <!-- Your link to your CSS file -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="">
    <!-- Your Javascript file goes here -->
    <script src="" async defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- your HTML should go here -->
    <nav>
      <h1>Let's Play the Guessing Number Game!</h1>
    </nav>
  </body>
</html>
```
Let's open the `index.html` file in the browser by running the following command:
`$ open index.html`

## CSS File

Your CSS file is basically empty at the moment. Once you complete the Javascript portion of the Challenge where you're able to Submit a number and tell the user that they've WON or not.

Remember, don't worry about styling to begin with.

## Step 1: Create the required HTML Elements
First, create the HTML elements needed to `<input>` a value and a `<button>` to submit your answer.
