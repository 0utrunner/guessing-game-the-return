# Guess A Number
=======================
## This challenge will help you to:
- Implement HTML elements that use specific attributes to perform actions
- Implement CSS styling using `id=`s and `class=`es
- Use Javascript to interact with your web page or the Docuement Object Model (DOM)
- Use HTML or DOM methods to change your webpage

## Summary
Let's create a simple number guessing game. The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 100 and you will have to guess that number.

Your number guessing game will consist of an HTML file, CSS file, and a Javascript file.

## HTML File
Your HTML file is already given to you with a `<nav>` element and a `<h1>` tag.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>TITLE</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <!-- Your link to your CSS file -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="">
    <!-- Your Javascript file goes here -->
    <script src="" async defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- your HTML should go here -->
    <nav>
      <h1>Let's Play the Guessing Number Game!</h1>
    </nav>
  </body>
</html>
```

Remember, don't worry about styling to begin with.

## Step 1: Create the required HTML Elements
First, create the HTML elements needed to `<input>` a value and a `<button>` to submit your answer.
